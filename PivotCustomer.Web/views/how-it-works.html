                Pivot starts out easy - with a nine-day program that helps you understand your smoking behavior.
                Because once you know where you are, it's easier to figure out how to get where you want to go.

                        It's true: We don't start with quit. We start with discovery. During these nine days, your employees get
                        to know their coach, use their new breath sensor, and complete daily activities.

                        Participants who are ready to quit work with their coach to build a quit plan in as quickly as one day.

                        Your employees execute their quit plan, based on evidence-based strategies shown to increase the likelihood
                        of success—such as acquiring medications, arranging support, and preparing a craving kit.

                    <p>
                        Because Pivot approaches quitting as a skillset, rather than a single act, your employees now have the skills
                        they need to take this next step.

                        And because you’ve provided a platform that is with them for the long haul, your newly smoke-free employees
                        receive continued coaching, lessons, and practice designed for the vital first few weeks after a quit attempt.

                        The focus shifts to maintenance. For up to a full year after their quit date, your employees continue to build
                        skills and confidence, while their coaches provide support designed to prevent relapse.
